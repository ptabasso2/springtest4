## APM Java lab - the definitive working example showing various techniques to trace a Java example


### Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to cover various activities around tracing and APM. Each activity of the lab is covered in a dedicated branch.
The structure is as follows:

main: Vanilla java application consisting of a Spring Boot application that exposes a single endpoint </br>
02: That section highlights auto-instrumentation done through the use of the java tracer </br>
03: This section shows a practical example of manual tracing where spans are generated using the java sdk </br>
04: Example of manual tracing combining the sdk and the java agent (use of the tracer loaded by the java agent) </br>
05: Manual tracing using the asChildOf() opentracing idiom <br> 
06: Manual tracing covering inter-processing communication using the tracer.inject()/extract() idioms for context propagation <br> 
07: Log injection: Automatic instrumentation and trace_id/span_id injection into logs </br>

In each section, we'll describe the various steps to follow in order to reach the goal.
The activities in this lab follow a logical order so that the solutions of the current activity are available at the beginning of the very next activity.
For example, the solution of activity 03 is presented at the beginning of activity 04.
It will serve as the work base for this activity and the instructions described in step 4 will take you to the next stage and so on so forth


### Goal of this activity (`base` branch)

This exercise is only meant to familiarize yourself with the structure of the project (directory structure, file names) but also the steps to follow to build, run and test the application.
There won't be much change in the code.

31 directories, 16 files

</pre>

The main components of this project can be described as follows:
+ The `src` directory that contains the two class forming our app. The Application class will contain the implementation details to bootstrap the app. It can be seen as the class exposing the main method that will spin up the app. </br>
  The `BasicController` class will contain the details related to the endpoint that will be exposed. </br> There is also a configuration files that will contain the properties / settings that will be used by the application. </br> In the current version, it contains the logger configuration settings
+ The `build.gradle` file is the build configuraton file used by gradle.
+ The `build` directory contains the generated classes and archive file resulting from the compilation/build steps.  


### Build the application

<pre style="font-size: 12px">
COMP10619:~ pejman.tabassomi$ ./gradlew build

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0.
Use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings.
See https://docs.gradle.org/6.9.1/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
3 actionable tasks: 3 executed

</pre>


At this stage, the artifact that will be produced (`springtest4-1.0.jar`) will be placed under the `./build/libs` directory that gets created during the build process.


### Run the application

Running the application is fairly simple:

<pre style="font-size: 12px">
COMP10619:~ pejman.tabassomi$ java -jar build/libs/springtest4-1.0.jar

### Test the application

In another terminal run the following command, you should receive the answer `Ok`

<pre style="font-size: 12px">
COMP10619:~ pejman.tabassomi$ curl localhost:8080/Callme
Ok
